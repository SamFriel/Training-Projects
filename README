These projects are kept the same as the Instructor Anegla Yu had done in her videos.
I did have more personalized ones but had deleted them over the standardized and accurate ones. As such
I haven't changed the tag for the copyright at the bottom, nor have I changed any of her annotations as
I learned. These are not all the things we did in the Bootcamp, but a good portion of the ones I feel
would be most essential.
